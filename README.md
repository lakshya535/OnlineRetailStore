# OnlineRetailStore

The project implements a database application based on an online retail store. In the
application, sellers could add the things they want to sell via the application, and different
customers would be able to buy the things they are interested in. This project tries to implement
relationships between different entities and stakeholders to ensure an efficient flow
between them.
